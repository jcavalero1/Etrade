# Etrade
Provide a description of the incident and how you were victimized. Provide information not captured elsewhere in this complaint form.
Etrade "said" they removed the restrictions but they left the restrictions on after we had a 3 way conversation with Capital One to determine that the money I sent them was from a savings account at Capital One. I am spending the money when they lift the restrictions (some not all) I was at Wal-Mart paying for groceries and a check I wrote at home came back and and there was $5000 in the account. They kept me talking for one hour and waiting for them to come back to the phone.
Last Thursday I initiated an ACH transfer to Metairie Bank and put in to move the bulk and they immediately put all the restrictions back and made me spend all day trying to get Metairie Bank say I have a bank account with them to send the money to and I already did the two amounts and linked my savings account to my checking at Etrade. They are still holding my money hostage.
I can't spend checks or pay for food and it's been 8 weeks.
Morgan Stanley wrote an email staying they lifted the restrictions and cc'd SEC Attorney Trevor Perkins but the restrictions weren't removed. (They lied to an Attorney) This is a Ponzi scam.
They are still sending the same letters to my email and still not lifting the restrictions. They said we are going to remove the restrictions on your account of you send us a statement and I sent the statement and everything that proves I have an account at Metairie Bank and they are still taking to let me move my money to anywhere.
*See Preston Dwyer.

Addendum:

Etrade sent a letter that they closed my accounts before I can get the money out. They decided to keep the $34000.

Last Saturday the agent said to call on Monday and they would send me a check and I called on 
Monday and they said I needed to uncover the digits I covered up on my Social Security card (All but the last 4) I've already sent my credentials but they continue to ask to keep resending them. They keep sending letters that the restrictions are off to go ahead and transfer your money to Metairie bank. Nothing works at the site but the money is still in the checking account and the brokerage account and the savings account has been removed had $3000 in it.
